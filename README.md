# League of Legends ETL and Data Analysis Project

Purpose of this project: Practice at the management of a database and development of ETL pipelines in python. Gain skills at using an API and parsing JSON data.

Python Libraries used: psycopg3, polars, RiotWatcher, gspread

Data that is retrieved here is then exported to various places. First into a PostgreSQL database and then to Google Drive (for use there or to be used in Tableau Public) or PowerBI.
